# CNS-Project

Our project is based on the 2014 Kaggle competition American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction). We used the intracranial data provided by Kaggle to write 
our own code to predict if a given time segment is pre-seizure or not. Cues are also taken from the competition 
winner's code (https://github.com/drewabbot/kaggle-seizure-prediction/blob/master/report.md).

Our team: Kaur Karus, Krister Jaanhold, Brait Ã•ispuu, Mari Liis Velner
